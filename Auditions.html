            <h1>Auditioning</h1>
            <p>
                Auditioning can be a stressful process, but with the right preparation, you can feel confident and perform at your best. 
                Many even call auditioning its own art. Here are some tips for successfully navigating your next audition:
            </p>

            <h2>Prepare Your Material</h2>
            <p>
                Choose audition material that shows off your strengths.Memorize your lines, songs, or choreography and make sure you’re familiar with the material inside and out.
		And this is a big one: 
		Start preparing your materials ASAP. Whether they are songs or monologues. Many auditions will come in the form of two contrasting monologues,
		two contrasting songs, or a mix of both. Many actors build up their own repetoire of material that they know very well for their use.
            </p>

            <h2>Research the Role</h2>
            <p>
                Understand the character or piece you are auditioning for. The more you know about the role, the better you can shape your performance.
		For example, a good recommendation if you were to audition for any Golden Age Musical (Around 1940-1960 Broadway) is to research
		into the era. Especially with consideration to the setting of the musical itself. Knowing things like the playwrights beliefs and
		intentions can also be important things to research.
            </p>

            <h2>Confidence and Calm</h2>
            <p>
                Walk into the audition room with confidence. Take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that you’ve prepared for this moment. 
                Keep your nerves in check and focus on your performance. One of the best pieces of advice you'll find that you'll see time and time again
		is that whoever is auditioning you wants you to succeed. Another thing to keep in mind is that while it may feel impossible, avoid
		comparing yourself to others. The person who you think has the perfect 'look' for the role, may be the furthest person from the director's mind for it.
            </p>

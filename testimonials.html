            <h1>Testimonials</h1>
            <p>
                Theatre is not easy. If you've acted for long enough, then that is a truth that you get very familliar with. But other people are in, or have been in your place as well.
		Don't give up! When the curtain opens up and the lights turn on, magic happens. Whether you need an extra push to try it, or some encouragement to go on, hopefully these
		stories from some of your peers can inspire you.
            </p>

            <h2>Embrace the Stage</h2>
            <p>
               “Being part of Newtown’s theatre program has honestly been life-changing for me. It’s not just about acting and performing.
 		It’s about finding a place where you feel like you belong. Rehearsals are a mix of chaos and fun, where you’re laughing one minute and getting deep into character the next. 
		Of course tech week is a nightmare and everyone is either sick or stressed. But when the show comes together, and the lights go up, it’s this incredible feeling of, ‘Wow, we really did this.’ It’s something I’ll carry with me forever.”
            </p>

            <h2>Find Your Place</h2>
            <p>
                “Newtown High School’s theatre program isn’t just a high school activity, it feels like a second home. The people involved in theatre are so passionate and supportive, and you can really feel how much everyone cares about each producti
		It’s not always easy, which a lot of people do not know. Most people think that the hardest thing about theatre is performing in front of people but there are late nights, stressful rehearsals, and moments where you wonder if it’ll all come together. 
		But then it does, and it’s better than you could’ve imagined. I’ve learned so much about myself through theatre and can not wait to use what I’ve learned to pursue this in the future.”
            </p>

            <h2>I Secretly Love Tech Week</h2>
            <p>
		“Theatre is something I didn’t realize I needed until I joined. It’s not just about performing on stage; it’s about being part of a team that becomes your family. 
		You bond over everything whether it’s the late-night rehearsals, the last-minute changes, the laughs when things go completely wrong or if a fellow actor misses a scene because they fell asleep backstage. 
		And then, somehow, it all works out, and you’re standing in the spotlight thinking, ‘This is why I do this.’ Musical Theatre gave me confidence I didn’t know I had and memories I get to always hold onto.”
            </p>

   	    <h2>Step Out That Shell!</h2>
            <p>
		“What I love most about theatre is how it pushes you. It’s not always easy when you’re balancing school, personal life, and hours of rehearsal, but the challenge is what makes it so worth it.
		When I get to be up there on stage and see the audience smiling, clapping, or even crying, I realize that not only am I getting to do what I love but also share this love with an audience. 
		It’s such a powerful feeling to be part of something bigger than yourself. That’s what theatre has given me."
            </p>

   	    <h2>You Find Your People</h2>
            <p>
		“Newtown High’s theatre is so much more than just putting on shows, it's about the connections you make and the lessons you learn.
		I’ve met some of my closest friends here, and together we’ve created things that I’m genuinely proud of. The directors care so much about us, not just as performers but as people, and that makes all the difference.
		Being part of this program has taught me how to be brave, how to trust myself, and how to create something beautiful with others. It’s been an unforgettable experience.”

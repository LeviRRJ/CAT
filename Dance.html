            <h1>Stay in Character</h1>
            <p>
             Dancing in theater isn’t just about executing steps—it's about embodying the character while you move. Your body language, facial expressions, and energy all need to reflect the role you're playing. Whether it’s a high-energy number or a slow, emotional piece, remember to stay connected to your character throughout the performance. Let the movement flow from the emotions and motivations of the character, so your dance becomes more than choreography—it becomes storytelling.

            <h2>Dance Classes</h2>
            <p>
	    Taking regular dance classes can be extremely helpful for improving your technique and building strength. Whether you're learning ballet, jazz, hip-hop, or contemporary, classes offer structured training that hones your skills. Instructors provide corrections that help you understand the mechanics of movement, and the repetition builds muscle memory. Consistent training ensures that you’re prepared for the demands of theater choreography, and learning different styles will make you a more versatile performer.
              </p>

            <h2>Ask Questions</h2>
            <p>
		Never hesitate to ask questions in dance rehearsals or classes. If you're unclear about a step, transition, or style, asking for clarification is key to improving. It shows that you're engaged and eager to learn, and instructors or choreographers will appreciate your attention to detail. Questions can also help you understand the purpose behind movements, allowing you to connect more deeply with the choreography. In theater, precision and clarity in dance are crucial, so asking questions ensures you're fully prepared to deliver your best performance.

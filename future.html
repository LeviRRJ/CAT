            <h1>College</h1>
            <p>
                If you want to continue acting at the next level of education, majoring or minoring in it in College can be a great choice. Many colleges offer BAs in theatre
		or BFAs in things like Acting and Musical theatre. Don't be afraid if stage management is more your thing! There are plenty of majors for stage management, tech, and even set design and costuming.
		If you're thinking about theatre in college, then start as early as you can! Thinking about and preparing your audition materials during your junior year can make senior year a lot less stressful
		when it'll feel like you have another prescreen or audition every other week. If price is an issue, WCSU is a great option for a state school. And remember, always ask your drama teachers and your peers for help!
            </p>

            <h2>Hobby</h2>
            <p>
                Acting training can be extremely expensive, and it can feel difficult to continue once you finish High School. But this does not mean that you need to quit!
		Community theatre is a great way to stay connected to the world of acting. Musicals at Richter is a great option, especially if you want to try something new in the form of outdoor theater.
		Community theater also allows you to meet a variety of people that otherwise, you would never be able to.
            </p>

            <h2>Conservatory</h2>
            <p>
                Conservatory training can be another great option, but remember to be careful. Conservatory training can be a mixed bag, it can be very difficult to tell what
		you are going to get. Prices could range from a couple hundred to thousands upon thousands of dollars. There are people out there that look to monopolize
		and profit off of young actor's dreams so caution must be exercised. Always cross reference an acting teacher before you sign up for ANYTHING. Anything
		that sounds too good to be true, may really be a scam. However, a good teacher can transform your acting to another level. 
            </p>

            <h2>It'll Be Okay</h2>
            <p>
                You've gotten this far right? Everything will be okay, you don't have to decide anything permanently for your future. There are plenty of working actors that have never 
		studied acting in college, and there are plenty of people who found success in other business or careers after they studied acting and then decided they wanted something else for their lives.
		Life will be full of opporunities for you to act and if you want to continue it, then you will. The stage has a way of finding people.
